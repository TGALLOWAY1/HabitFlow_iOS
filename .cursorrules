You are working on HabitFlow iOS.

You MUST follow the HabitFlow Color & Style Guidelines.
You MUST follow the HabitFlow Canonical Vocabulary and iOS Feature Spec.

Hard rules:
- Never introduce punitive colors, copy, or visual states
- Never invent completion, streak, or progress states
- All UI completion is derived from HabitEntry truth
- Prefer subtle emphasis over strong contrast
- Favor calm, low-saturation palettes
- UI must feel supportive, not evaluative

If a design choice conflicts with:
1) Canonical Vocabulary
2) iOS Feature Spec
3) These Style Guidelines

The design choice is invalid.
